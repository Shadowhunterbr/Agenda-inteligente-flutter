## About Agenda inteligente

This work, which was developed by the group members, refers to the creation of
a ‘Smart Schedule’ application. Objective : To improve people’s lives through notes that
they can make within their diary, along with alarms that can also be set, so that they do
not have the chance to miss their appointments (or have the chance to be late), always
seeking satisfaction and seeking improvements during project processing, at the same time
as it is a practical application for Android cell phones. Development : This application
was developed using the Flutter (Flutlab) tool (IDE program), focusing on the front-end
on the user’s screen, and the functions it performs after the commands entered by the
user to carry out and apply the alarm..
